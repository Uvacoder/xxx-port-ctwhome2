I am starting to play with the idea of moving all my organization, notes, sketches, to-do's to a single application by following the Zettelkasten Method as personal knowledge management.

The main idea is that this organization lasts a lifetime, independently of any platform and application. Just basic pen and paper was enough for Niklas Luhmann, a social scientist, to publish 50 Books and over 600 articles.

The ideas resemble pretty much how Wikipedia is structured, closer to a Web. All articles link to other links and are intertwined.

## Principles

A few principles I get from the article [Zettelkasten â€” How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) are:

*   Atomicity
*   Autonomy
*   Connection between notes
*   Using tags instead of categories
*   Use your own words and keep it simple
*   Never delete anything
*   Link Reference pages to connect all the dots, like maps

## Writing down the notes

Taking notes to go via:

1.  Fleeting notes: ideas, quotes, references, links, images.
2.  Literature notes extractions from books and papers.

Processing the notes permanently:

1.  Permanent notes: writing with your own words in a way that you will understand in 10 years forward.
2.  Index notes: hyperlinks with notes nodes and mapping.
3.  Keyword notes: Tags list
