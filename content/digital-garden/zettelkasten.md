I am starting playing with the idea of moving all my organization, notes, sketches, todo's to a single application by following the Zettelkasten Method as a personal knowledgme manadgment. 

The main idea is that this organization lasts a lifetime, independently of any platform and application. Just basic pen an paper was enough for Niklas Luhmann, a social scientis, to publish 50 Books and over 600 articles. 


The ideas reesambles pretty much how the the Wikipedia is structured, closer to a Web. All articles link to other links and are intertwined.


## Principles
A few principles I get from the article [Zettelkasten â€” How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) are: 

- Atomicity
- Autonomy
- Connection between notes
- Using tags instead of cathegories
- Use your own words and keep it simple
- Never delete anything
- Link Reference pages to connect all the dots, like maps

Taking notes go via:
1. Fleeting notes:  ideas, quotes, references, links, images.
2. Literature notes: extractions from books and papers. 

Processing the notes permanently:
3. Permanent notes: writting with you own words in a way taht you will understand in 10 years fordward.
4. Index notes: hyperlinks with notes nodes and mapping.
5. Keyword notes: Tags list
